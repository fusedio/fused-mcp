It allows optional filtering by year and country, and returns comprehensive information including purpose of visit, growth rate, and number of visitor arrivals.\n\nInput Parameters:\n- year (int, optional): The year for which detailed visitor data is requested. If not specified, data for all available years will be returned.\n- country (str, optional): The country for which visitor data is requested. If not specified, data for all countries will be returned.\n\nOutput:\nReturns a Pandas DataFrame with the following columns:\n- Country/Area\n- Purpose_of_visit_to_Japan\n- Year\n- Growth Rate(%)\n- Visitor Arrivals\n\nIf no matching records are found, an empty DataFrame with the above column structure is returned.\n\nTechnical Details and Limitations:\n- The CSV is fetched from a public Google Drive link using HTTP requests. Internet access is required.\n- The 'Year' column is cast to integer for filtering.\n- The function gracefully handles missing or empty fields, such as blank growth rates or visitor counts.\n- If the source format of the CSV changes, the behavior may be affected.\n    ","parameters":[{"name":"year","type":"integer","default":null,"description":"The year to filter visitor data.
